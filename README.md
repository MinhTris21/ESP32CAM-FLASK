Project Title: License Plate Detection and Registration System Using ESP32-CAM and Python Flask
Student ID: 21200363
Project Overview:
This project develops an automated license plate detection and registration system using the ESP32-CAM microcontroller. The system leverages computer vision techniques to capture and process images of vehicle license plates, extract alphanumeric characters, and register the data via a web interface built with Python Flask.
Key Features:
Real-Time Image Capture: Utilizes the ESP32-CAM's OV2640 camera module to capture high-quality images of vehicle license plates.
License Plate Recognition: Implements image processing and optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to detect and extract license plate numbers accurately.
Web-Based Registration: A Python Flask web application provides a user-friendly interface to display, store, and manage detected license plate data.
Scalable Design: Integrates lightweight processing on the ESP32-CAM with server-side computation for efficient performance.
Technologies Used:
Hardware: ESP32-CAM microcontroller
Programming Languages:C++ (for ESP32-CAM), Python (for Flask and OCR), SQL (database)
Frameworks & Libraries: Python Flask, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR
Communication: Wi-Fi for real-time data transfer between ESP32-CAM and Flask server
