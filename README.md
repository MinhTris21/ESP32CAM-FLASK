This project develops an automated system for detecting and registering vehicle license plates using the ESP32-CAM. The system captures images, processes them to extract license plate numbers, and stores the data via SQL workbench

Real-Time Image Capture: Captures high-quality images using the ESP32-CAM's OV2640 camera module.

License Plate Recognition: Uses image processing and OCR (via Tesseract) to detect and extract license plate numbers accurately.

Web-Based Registration: A Python Flask web app provides an interface to display, store, and manage license plate data.

Scalable Design: Combines lightweight processing on the ESP32-CAM with server-side computation for efficiency.

Data Storage: Integrates SQL for persistent storage of license plate records.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Hardware: ESP32-CAM microcontroller

Programming Languages:

C++ (for ESP32-CAM firmware)

Python (for Flask web app and OCR processing)

Frameworks & Libraries:

Python Flask (web framework)

OpenCV (image processing)

Tesseract OCR (text extraction)

SQL workbench (database)

Communication: Wi-Fi for real-time data transfer between ESP32-CAM and Flask server

üìã System Architecture

ESP32-CAM: Captures images and performs initial processing (e.g., grayscale conversion, edge detection).

Image Transmission: Sends processed images to the Flask server over Wi-Fi.

Flask Server: Uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to extract license plate numbers and store them in SQLite.

Web Interface: Displays detected plates and allows users to manage records (view, edit, delete).
